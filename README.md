# age_calculator
A simple age calculator for my first tiny project, using user input, subtraction, and converting the input from a string to an integer.


## ðŸ’¡ How it works

The program:
1. Asks for your birth year
2. Calculates your age based on the current year (assuming it's still 2025)
3. Prints the result


### Example

What year were you born? 2008
You are 17 years old.


## ðŸ›  Tech used
- Python 3


## ðŸ“š What I learned
- How to get user input with `input()`
- Converting strings to integers with `int()`
- Simple arithmetic and `print()`
